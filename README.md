# gdx_font
A script that streams a custom font to the game, in this case the Fire Sans font, which supports diacritics

This script was created using the following instructions: https://fivem-dev.cz/index.php?/topic/30-streamov%C3%A1n%C3%AD-fontu/

### Script integration:
- `SetTextFont(font_id)` - Font ID is printed when the script is started in the F8 console
- A`ddTextComponentSubstringPlayerName("<font face='Fire Sans'>"..msg.."</font>")` - for blips and other texts where diacritics don't work
- If there is any problem, you can contact me on discord: `Gdany#2835`
